It's because the Common Sand Tiger is a shallow water species, and the fishermen have wiped out the shallow water sharks.

PRICELESS GALLERIES Artist Biography EYVAND EARLE .Born in New York in 1916, Eyvind Earle began his prolific career at the age of ten when his father, Ferdinand Earle, gave him a challenging choice: read 50 pages of a book or paint a picture every day. Earle choose both. From the time of his first one-man showing in France when he was 14, Earle's fame had grown steadily. At the age of 21, Earle bicycled across country from Hollywood to New York, paying his way by painting 42 watercolors. In 1937, he opened at the Charles Morgan Galleries, his first of many one-man shows in New York. Two years later at his third consecutive showing at the gallery, the response to his work was so positive that the exhibition sold out and the Metropolitan Museum of Art purchased one of his paintings for their permanent collection. His earliest work was strictly realistic, but after having studied the work of a variety of masters such as Van Gogh, Cézanne, Rockwell, Kent and Georgia O'Keefe, Earle by the age of 21, came into his own unique style. His oeuvre is characterized by a simplicity, directness and surety of handling. .

HEMIPRISTIS shark jaw (also called SNAGGLETOOTH) (Hemipristis elongatus),
4"" wide x 3"" tall.
T**th and cartilage are good, some upper t**th turned in.
From Glenn Reed personal collection, obtained from a shipment from the Philippines in 1990 ""unidentified"".  Dr. Purdy and his staff from the Smithsonian National History Museum came to his shop in Myrtle Beach (Sharks T**th Cove) for the annual f0ssil show, and attempted to identify these.  Much to their surprise, their staff of six had never seen this species.  It took 8 months of research dealing with NOAA and Dr. Castro before it was determined that these were Hemipristis, believed to be extinct.  There were six in the original group of jaws.
THIS IS THE EXACT JAW YOU WOULD RECEIVE.
Hemipristis
is a genus of weasel shark, family Hemigaleidae.  It contains one extant species, the snaggletooth shark (
H. pristis
), as well as several extinct species.
Hemipristis
has two distinct type of t**th in each section of its jaw. The ones on the upper jaw act like knives, cutting through the flesh of the prey, while the pointed ones on the bottom act like forks, spearing the prey and holding it down.
THESE SHARKS ARE NOT CAUGHT FOR THEIR JAWS.  All shark jaws are obtained from the legal fishing industry in the Philippines and off the coast of India in the Indian Ocean.   These sharks are caught for their hides & meat.  The jaws are sold as a collectible to recycle 100% of the shark.
We do not support sport fishing, illegal taking of sharks, we don't even eat in restaurants that serve Shark Fin soup due to the cruel and wasteful nature of shark finning.  We do not catch sharks ourselves.

The bluntnose sixgill shark, often simply called the cow shark , is the largest hexanchoid shark, growing to more than 5.4 m. (18 feet) long. Many of its relatives are extinct. The living species that are closest genetically include the dogfish, the Greenland shark , as well as other six- and sevengilled sharks. There are more closely related relatives in the fossil record than living species. Some of the shark's relatives date back to 200 million years ago. Although sluggish in nature, the bluntnose sixgill shark is capable of attaining high speeds for chasing and catching its prey. Because of the bluntnose sixgill shark's large and diverse range they have a wide variety of prey items. Their diet consists of a variety of mollusks, crustaceans, Agnathans (which is a family consisting of hagfish), and sea lampreys . They also dine on Cape anchovies, Pacific salmon, various species of hake. THESE SHARKS ARE NOT CAUGHT FOR THEIR JAWS.

Each one will be a bit different (specimen size, color and posture) even in the same production batch. The pictures in the listing are just for reference as we are selling multiple pieces with same pictures. *** Tiger Shark ( Galeocerdo cuvier ) This large, dangerous shark is to tropical waters what the great white is to temperate waters. It is named fro the dark strips on its gray back, which pronounced in juveniles but become pale or disappear in large adults. Its wide mouth, broad nose, barrel chest, and the slenderness at the base of its tail are distinctive. So, too, are its heavily serrated, cockscomb-shaped teeth. These, combined with its jaw strength, allow it to cut the bodies of large sea turtles, as well as seals, sea lions, and cetaceans. They are active at night, and enter shallow reefs and lagoons after dusk to feed. In certain areas they migrate between island groups to take advantage of colonies of young birds learning to fly over water. Generally, tiger sharks are sluggish, but they can move quickly when feeding, and should be treated carefully on the rare occasions they are sighted. If you see one while diving, calmly leave the water, keeping it in sight at all times. Diet One of the few true scavengers, it has eaten cattle, pigs, donkeys, sheep, and humans that have fallen overboard. It also has a liking for such spicy treats as venomous jellyfish, stingrays, and sea snakes. Reproduction The tiger shark is the only ovoviviparous requiem shark. It has between 10 and 82 pups after a years gestation. The young are 20-30"" (50-75cm) at birth. The mature after about 4 to 6 years, and live for about 12 years. Habitat Adult tiger sharks spend their days beyond the reef edge to depths of about 500' (150m), except at certain times of the year, when they also come inshore during the day. Range The tiger shark ranges world-wide in tropical waters, but has been spotted in the Bay of Fundy at the mouth of Le Preau tangled in fishing weir. Distinguishing Characteristics Extremely dangerous The shark's powerful body makes it capable of bursts of speed.

These, combined with its jaw strength, allow it to cut the bodies of large sea turtles, as well as seals, sea lions, and cetaceans. They are active at night, and enter shallow reefs and lagoons after dusk to feed. In certain areas they migrate between island groups to take advantage of colonies of young birds learning to fly over water. Generally, tiger sharks are sluggish, but they can move quickly when feeding, and should be treated carefully on the rare occasions they are sighted. If you see one while diving, calmly leave the water, keeping it in sight at all times. Diet One of the few true scavengers, it has eaten cattle, pigs, donkeys, sheep, and humans that have fallen overboard. It also has a liking for such spicy treats as venomous jellyfish, stingrays, and sea snakes. Reproduction The tiger shark is the only ovoviviparous requiem shark. It has between 10 and 82 pups after a years gestation. The young are 20-30"" (50-75cm) at birth. The mature after about 4 to 6 years, and live for about 12 years. Habitat Adult tiger sharks spend their days beyond the reef edge to depths of about 500' (150m), except at certain times of the year, when they also come inshore during the day. Range The tiger shark ranges world-wide in tropical waters, but has been spotted in the Bay of Fundy at the mouth of Le Preau tangled in fishing weir. Distinguishing Characteristics Extremely dangerous The shark's powerful body makes it capable of bursts of speed.

SANDTIGER (COMMON) SHARK
The Smallt**th Sand Tiger usually has t**th (especially the lateral t**th) with two cusplets on each side whereas the Common Sand Tiger always has only one set of cusplets on each side of the t**th. The Smallt**th used to be very rare, but now the Common Sand Tiger has become the rarer shark. It's because the Common Sand Tiger is a shallow water species, and the fishermen have wiped out the shallow water sharks. Now they have moved to deeper water where the Smallt**th is found, and so we are seeing more of these turn up. So, a Common Sand Tiger jaw is now worth more than the jaw from a Smallt**th Sand Tiger.
THESE SHARKS ARE NOT CAUGHT FOR THEIR JAWS. All shark jaws are obtained from the legal fishing industry in the Philippines and off the coast of India in the Indian Ocean. These sharks are caught for their hides & meat. The jaws & t**th are sold as a collectible to recycle 100% of the shark.
We do not support sport fishing, illegal taking of sharks, we don't even eat in restaurants that serve Shark Fin soup due to the cruel and wasteful nature of shark finning. We do not catch sharks ourselves.

About Us
The
Fossil Exchange was created by two professional SCUBA divers with a passion for collecting fossilized shark teeth 40 miles off the coast of North Carolina.
Diving to depths of over 110ft, we recover Megalodon Teeth from fossil beds on the ocean floor. The ocean conditions can be challenging, and the dangers at depth are real, but the reward is worth the risk. To hold a 5.6 Million year old tooth from the largest predator the world has ever known (Carcharocles Megalodon) is an experience like no other.
Our Megalodon teeth and fossils come straight from the source, from the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to you!
You can rest assured that every Megalodon Tooth we sell is 100 % real, and recovered by us.
NO restorations, NO alterations, and NO reselling.
Over the years, we have collected a wide variety of fossils ranging from affordable Megalodon Teeth all the way up to the highest quality specimens in the world. We have sold our treasures around the world, and you can always buy with confidence from The Fossil Exchange.

THIS IS THE EXACT JAW YOU WOULD RECEIVE.
Hemipristis
is a genus of weasel shark, family Hemigaleidae.  It contains one extant species, the snaggletooth shark (
H. pristis
), as well as several extinct species.
Hemipristis
has two distinct type of t**th in each section of its jaw. The ones on the upper jaw act like knives, cutting through the flesh of the prey, while the pointed ones on the bottom act like forks, spearing the prey and holding it down.
THESE SHARKS ARE NOT CAUGHT FOR THEIR JAWS.  All shark jaws are obtained from the legal fishing industry in the Philippines and off the coast of India in the Indian Ocean.   These sharks are caught for their hides & meat.  The jaws are sold as a collectible to recycle 100% of the shark.
We do not support sport fishing, illegal taking of sharks, we don't even eat in restaurants that serve Shark Fin soup due to the cruel and wasteful nature of shark finning.  We do not catch sharks ourselves.

BLUNTNOSE SIX GILL COW shark (
Hexanchus griseus
) jaw is 19"" wide
.
Awesome jaw!  Great gift for the shark lover!
This is the exact jaw you will receive!
BLUNTNOSE SIX GILL COW SHARK
Highly unusual tooth formation.
The bluntnose sixgill shark, often simply called the
cow shark
, is the largest hexanchoid shark, growing to more than 5.4 m. (18 feet) long.
Many of its relatives are extinct.  The living species that are closest genetically include the dogfish, the
Greenland shark
, as well as other six- and sevengilled sharks. There are more closely related relatives in the fossil record than living species. Some of the shark's relatives date back to 200 million years ago.
Although sluggish in nature, the bluntnose sixgill shark is capable of attaining high speeds for chasing and catching its prey. Because of the bluntnose sixgill shark's large and diverse range they have a wide variety of prey items. Their diet consists of a variety of mollusks, crustaceans, Agnathans (which is a family consisting of hagfish), and
sea lampreys
. They also dine on Cape anchovies, Pacific salmon, various species of hake.
THESE SHARKS ARE NOT CAUGHT FOR THEIR JAWS.  All shark jaws are obtained from the legal fishing industry in the Philippines and off the coast of India in the Indian Ocean.   These sharks are caught for their hides & meat.  The jaws & teeth are sold as a collectible to recycle 100% of the shark.
We do not support sport fishing, illegal taking of sharks, we don't even eat in restaurants that serve Shark Fin soup due to the cruel and wasteful nature of shark finning.  We do not catch sharks ourselves.

INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS: There is a $93 fee we are required to pay U.S. Fish & Wildlife to inspect the package going outside the United States.  I may be able to discount this off for you depending on the size of jaw, though I still have to pay the fee.  Or combine numerous jaws and I can discount it off.  Yes, I wish I did not have this fee requirement.  But it is the law.",1,"(sj390-35) 19"" BLUNTNOSE SIX GILL COW SHARK jaw I love sharks jaws taxidermy   | eBay. eBay

It is also present from south Africa to the southwestern Indian Ocean, in the Mediterranean and Black Seas. It is native possibly as far south as Namibia and South Africa Thornback rays feed mainly at night – they spend most of the daylight hours resting on the bottom, covered in sand for added camouflage. They feed on the bottom, picking off crustaceans, crabs and shrimps, but they will also eat small fish, worms, molluscs and echinoderms. There are rows of sharp thorns along the tail (often called bucklers). There are also a few spines scattered over the back too. THESE SHARKS/RAYS ARE NOT CAUGHT FOR THEIR JAWS.

THIS IS THE EXACT JAW YOU WILL RECEIVE
SANDTIGER (COMMON) SHARK
The Smallt**th Sand Tiger usually has t**th (especially the lateral t**th) with two cusplets on each side whereas the Common Sand Tiger always has only one set of cusplets on each side of the t**th. The Smallt**th used to be very rare, but now the Common Sand Tiger has become the rarer shark. It's because the Common Sand Tiger is a shallow water species, and the fishermen have wiped out the shallow water sharks. Now they have moved to deeper water where the Smallt**th is found, and so we are seeing more of these turn up. So, a Common Sand Tiger jaw is now worth more than the jaw from a Smallt**th Sand Tiger.
THESE SHARKS ARE NOT CAUGHT FOR THEIR JAWS. All shark jaws are obtained from the legal fishing industry in the Philippines and off the coast of India in the Indian Ocean. These sharks are caught for their hides & meat. The jaws & t**th are sold as a collectible to recycle 100% of the shark.
We do not support sport fishing, illegal taking of sharks, we don't even eat in restaurants that serve Shark Fin soup due to the cruel and wasteful nature of shark finning. We do not catch sharks ourselves.

Species
- Trigonotodus grandis - Extinct Giant Thresher Shark
Size
- 1.08"" long
Location
- Summerville, South Carolina
Age
- Oligocene - Appx 28.5 million years old
Remarks
- Uncommonly offered, colorful 1.08"" long fossil Extinct Giant Thresher Shark tooth from Summerville, SC. 100% authentic with no repair or restoration. Winning bidder to receive full geological data on all teeth.
Winning bidder in the United States will receive free shipping (by First Class or Priority Mail w/delivery confirmation within the USA only). International customers are responsible for shipping costs by AirMail or Priority Mail. Credit cards are accepted. Thanks for viewing and your bid.
99% of the teeth we sell are new to the market and have not been purchased from other dealers or shopped around at shows. We acquire the teeth either by buying direct from divers who sell exclusively to our company or by diving ourselves (but we don't use that as a marketing gimmick.....does it really matter whether I found a particular tooth or someone else did if you like it and the price is fair?). So what you are seeing here has not been offered before and you will be either the 2nd or 3rd owner of a very cool and collectible piece of history.
International customers are responsible for any customs duty charged by your country to import (if applicable, many countries have no duty or fairly high dollar requirements before one is charged). We are NOT responsible for nor do we have control of ANY of these charges and legally can not and will not alter the customs declaration. However our products are priced quite fairly and usually you will still pay less (often considerably less) for a tooth from us even after paying duty than from most other sellers so keep that in mind when purchasing.

Please note: Pictures are an example of what you will be receiving, they all look about the same.
W27k #10 This is a nice 5"" shark jaw from a common Spinner shark.  These are all natural. It is displayed in a floating frame so you can see both sides of the specimen.
This is a by product of the food fishing industry and was not killed for its jaws.  Every part of the shark is used.
Framed Display Approx. Dimensions:  8 x 7""
This is nicely showcased in a shadowbox type frame that suspends him in a clear elasticity film so both sides may be viewed unobstructed and also gives the specimen the
illusion of ""floating""!
This can be opened but I advise against it as the specimens or the elasticity strip usually are damaged when you open the display.  If the film in your display starts to stick together or gets some bubbles in it you can open the case very slowly so the film releases from both side and close again very slowly and the problem should be resolved.  If the film gets touched or is in a hot area this can happen but it is a very easy fix also s
ometimes in shipping the specimen can shift a little in the display.  If this happens please contact us and we will direct you on a quick and easy fix.
Once the display has been opened returns are no longer accepted.
The case will keep him clean and safe for years to come!
Species- Carcharhinus Brevipinna
The spinner shark is a species of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, named for the spinning leaps it makes as a part of its feeding strategy. This species occurs in tropical and warm temperate waters worldwide, except for in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

BLUNTNOSE SIX GILL COW shark (
Hexanchus griseus
) jaw is 16"" wide x 9"" tall
.
Awesome jaw!  Great gift for the shark lover!
BLUNTNOSE SIX GILL COW SHARK
Highly unusual tooth formation.
The bluntnose sixgill shark, often simply called the
cow shark
, is the largest hexanchoid shark, growing to more than 5.4 m. (18 feet) long.
Many of its relatives are extinct.  The living species that are closest genetically include the dogfish, the
Greenland shark
, as well as other six- and sevengilled sharks. There are more closely related relatives in the fossil record than living species. Some of the shark's relatives date back to 200 million years ago.
Although sluggish in nature, the bluntnose sixgill shark is capable of attaining high speeds for chasing and catching its prey. Because of the bluntnose sixgill shark's large and diverse range they have a wide variety of prey items. Their diet consists of a variety of mollusks, crustaceans, Agnathans (which is a family consisting of hagfish), and
sea lampreys
. They also dine on Cape anchovies, Pacific salmon, various species of hake.
THESE SHARKS ARE NOT CAUGHT FOR THEIR JAWS.  All shark jaws are obtained from the legal fishing industry in the Philippines and off the coast of India in the Indian Ocean.   These sharks are caught for their hides & meat.  The jaws & teeth are sold as a collectible to recycle 100% of the shark.
We do not support sport fishing, illegal taking of sharks, we don't even eat in restaurants that serve Shark Fin soup due to the cruel and wasteful nature of shark finning.  We do not catch sharks ourselves.
Click on our red Ebay store tag for
MANY more shark items!
INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS: There is a $93 fee we are required to pay U.S. Fish & Wildlife to inspect the package going outside the United States.  I may be able to discount this off for you depending on the size of jaw, though I still have to pay the fee.  Or combine numerous jaws and I can discount it off.  Yes, I wish I did not have this fee requirement.  But it is the law.",1,"(sj390-71) 16"" BLUNTNOSE SIX GILL COW SHARK jaw sharks taxidermy Ichthyology  | eBay. eBay

, as well as other six- and sevengilled sharks. There are more closely related relatives in the fossil record than living species. Some of the shark's relatives date back to 200 million years ago.
Although sluggish in nature, the bluntnose sixgill shark is capable of attaining high speeds for chasing and catching its prey. Because of the bluntnose sixgill shark's large and diverse range they have a wide variety of prey items. Their diet consists of a variety of mollusks, crustaceans, Agnathans (which is a family consisting of hagfish), and
sea lampreys
. They also dine on Cape anchovies, Pacific salmon, various species of hake.
THESE SHARKS ARE NOT CAUGHT FOR THEIR JAWS.  All shark jaws are obtained from the legal fishing industry in the Philippines and off the coast of India in the Indian Ocean.   These sharks are caught for their hides & meat.  The jaws & teeth are sold as a collectible to recycle 100% of the shark.
We do not support sport fishing, illegal taking of sharks, we don't even eat in restaurants that serve Shark Fin soup due to the cruel and wasteful nature of shark finning.  We do not catch sharks ourselves.

Thank you! After Purchase If no response is given after we contact you about your order we will ship the following Monday-Wednesday once the fish is ready to ship If no response is given within 1 week after we contact you on a fish that requires airport to airport cargo shipping you will be refunded! IMPORTANT- Please Read In Full Before Placing Your Order! Be mindful of the laws in your state before placing your order! If the fish selected are illegal in the state you reside in, your order will be cancelled! We are now happy to offer flat rate overnight shipping throughout the USA! We primarily ship using UPS Next Day Air, which ships straight to your doorstep. We ship out Monday thru Wednesday each week, and occasionally on Thursdays depending on the zone you are located in. Packages are typically delivered between 10:30 am -12:00 pm the following day. The shipping cost paid includes an insulated Styrofoam box, bags, heat/cold packs, etc. The day the shipping label is created, you'll receive an email with tracking information. If we suspect inclimate weather, we will delay your shipment until we feel it is safe to ship. We pack all of our orders with delays in mind, and rarely experience loss as a result. If your package is delayed, please contact UPS directly for further information and updates. Airport to Airport Delivery Airport to airport is typically the fastest, safest, and most economical shipping method for large fish or heavy orders. Airport to airport shipments are typically reserved for orders $300 and over and boxes over 50 pounds, but certain exceptions may apply. The fish are sent to your nearest Delta or Southwest cargo facility at your local airport, where you'll be able to pick them up and pay the shipping charge directly to the airline. The method of cargo is dependent on the best flight with the least amount of travel time. After placing your order, we will contact you to find the best flight for both you and the fish, as well as walk you through the process if you are unfamiliar with it. Please Note: Occasionally some airports require prepayment for shipping. Should this occur, we will provide you with the receipt and request payment of the shipping charges. Live Arrival Guarantee We take pride in our shipping and losses are a very rare occurrence, even when the boxes are delayed. Live arrival is always guaranteed given the conditions listed below are met. In the rare event of a fish arriving DOA, we offer full credit or refund as well as a refund on shipping (UPS shipping only, and if it is the only fish shipped). Conditions of Live Arrival Guarantee -The package must be received on the first delivery attempt. -The package must be sent to the correct address, and not a forwarding address. -A clear picture/video of the fish in the original, sealed bag must be sent to us within 2 hours of delivery. How Do We Treat Our Fish? The health and quality of the fish we sell is of upmost priority to us. For that reason, we take extra time and preparation with all fish as they arrive at our facility. All fish are treated based on the conditions they exhibit upon arrival-ranging from medications (praziquantel, nitrofurizone, copper sulfate, and methylene blue) as well as natural solutions like salt, heat, rich tannin water, and more. Providing our clients with healthy fish is our #1 goal. How Do We Prepare Fish For Shipping? Our knowledge and commitment to quality has made us a leading provider of rare fish throughout the United States. Shipping fish is a delicate process that encompasses a number of variables. When your order is placed, we do visual checks leading up on every fish to ensure they are at upmost health. To ship fish properly, especially sizable species, a period of fasting is required. This can last anywhere between 3 days to a week conservatively speaking. Additional treatments may be necessary, in which you will be contacted regarding a timeline on shipping. Our Commitment To You Exceptional service and an all-around positive experience is what we aim for at Global Fish Co. We pride ourselves on the relationships we build; both online and in-store, and providing a personalized experience to each person who receives a fish from us. Our commitment to our customers is providing fish at the highest quality and health for the best price that we can offer. We get the most enjoyment out of seeing our fish thrive for years in your tanks.",0,"XL Cornish Jack 16"" RARE-Live Tropical Freshwater Aquarium Fish  | eBay.

If the fish selected are illegal in the state you reside in, your order will be cancelled! We are now happy to offer flat rate overnight shipping throughout the USA! We primarily ship using UPS Next Day Air, which ships straight to your doorstep. We ship out Monday thru Wednesday each week, and occasionally on Thursdays depending on the zone you are located in. Packages are typically delivered between 10:30 am -12:00 pm the following day. The shipping cost paid includes an insulated Styrofoam box, bags, heat/cold packs, etc. The day the shipping label is created, you'll receive an email with tracking information. If we suspect inclimate weather, we will delay your shipment until we feel it is safe to ship. We pack all of our orders with delays in mind, and rarely experience loss as a result. If your package is delayed, please contact UPS directly for further information and updates. Airport to Airport Delivery Airport to airport is typically the fastest, safest, and most economical shipping method for large fish or heavy orders. Airport to airport shipments are typically reserved for orders $300 and over and boxes over 50 pounds, but certain exceptions may apply. The fish are sent to your nearest Delta or Southwest cargo facility at your local airport, where you'll be able to pick them up and pay the shipping charge directly to the airline. The method of cargo is dependent on the best flight with the least amount of travel time. After placing your order, we will contact you to find the best flight for both you and the fish, as well as walk you through the process if you are unfamiliar with it. Please Note: Occasionally some airports require prepayment for shipping. Should this occur, we will provide you with the receipt and request payment of the shipping charges. Live Arrival Guarantee We take pride in our shipping and losses are a very rare occurrence, even when the boxes are delayed. Live arrival is always guaranteed given the conditions listed below are met. In the rare event of a fish arriving DOA, we offer full credit or refund as well as a refund on shipping (UPS shipping only, and if it is the only fish shipped). Conditions of Live Arrival Guarantee -The package must be received on the first delivery attempt. -The package must be sent to the correct address, and not a forwarding address. -A clear picture/video of the fish in the original, sealed bag must be sent to us within 2 hours of delivery. How Do We Treat Our Fish? The health and quality of the fish we sell is of upmost priority to us. For that reason, we take extra time and preparation with all fish as they arrive at our facility. All fish are treated based on the conditions they exhibit upon arrival-ranging from medications (praziquantel, nitrofurizone, copper sulfate, and methylene blue) as well as natural solutions like salt, heat, rich tannin water, and more. Providing our clients with healthy fish is our #1 goal. How Do We Prepare Fish For Shipping? Our knowledge and commitment to quality has made us a leading provider of rare fish throughout the United States. Shipping fish is a delicate process that encompasses a number of variables. When your order is placed, we do visual checks leading up on every fish to ensure they are at upmost health. To ship fish properly, especially sizable species, a period of fasting is required. This can last anywhere between 3 days to a week conservatively speaking. Additional treatments may be necessary, in which you will be contacted regarding a timeline on shipping. Our Commitment To You Exceptional service and an all-around positive experience is what we aim for at Global Fish Co. We pride ourselves on the relationships we build; both online and in-store, and providing a personalized experience to each person who receives a fish from us. Our commitment to our customers is providing fish at the highest quality and health for the best price that we can offer. We get the most enjoyment out of seeing our fish thrive for years in your tanks.",xl cornish jack 16 rarelive tropical freshwater aquarium fish ebay xl cornish jack 16 rarelive tropical freshwater

The bluntnose sixgill shark, often simply called the cow shark , is the largest hexanchoid shark, growing to more than 5.4 m. (18 feet) long. Many of its relatives are extinct. The living species that are closest genetically include the dogfish, the Greenland shark , as well as other six- and sevengilled sharks. There are more closely related relatives in the fossil record than living species. Some of the shark's relatives date back to 200 million years ago. Although sluggish in nature, the bluntnose sixgill shark is capable of attaining high speeds for chasing and catching its prey. Because of the bluntnose sixgill shark's large and diverse range they have a wide variety of prey items. Their diet consists of a variety of mollusks, crustaceans, Agnathans (which is a family consisting of hagfish), and sea lampreys . They also dine on Cape anchovies, Pacific salmon, various species of hake. THESE SHARKS ARE NOT CAUGHT FOR THEIR JAWS. All shark jaws are obtained from the legal fishing industry in the Philippines and off the coast of India in the Indian Ocean. These sharks are caught for their hides & meat.

Fathead minnows are small forage fish not growing larger than 3 inches making them ideal forage for bluegill, hybrid bream, crappie and small largemouth bass. Their intended use in stocking new ponds is to jump start the forage base. Breeding early in the spring, baby minnows are eaten by bluegill fattening them before the summer spawning season. Baby minnows are also present in the summer months serving as forage for new largemouth bass. Once bass are stocked fathead minnows disappear quickly. This is ok as the bluegill have begun spawning and are capable of feeding the bass. Minnows can be stocked periodically to increase forage for bream in early spring and fall.Fathead minnows spawn in the spring when water temperatures reach 70 degrees F. Males become dark in color and grow rough patches on their heads. Males use this rough patch to clean the surface of the underside of submerged objects. Females lay their adhesive eggs to this clean surface and the males fertilize them. Males then guard the eggs until they hatch and the baby minnows are large enough to fend for themselves.Branches, leaves, old tires, pallets, tarps, boards or pvc pipe can be submerged along the shoreline to provide spawning habitat for minnows.

Today surface science impacts all major fields of study from physical to biological sciences, from physics to chemistry, and all engineering disciplines. The materials and phenomena characterized by surface science range from se- conductors, where the impact of surface science has been critical to progress, to metals and ceramics, where selected contributions have been important, to bio- terials, where contributions are just beginning to impact the field, to textiles, where the impact has been marginal.

CAT SHARK
Family: Scyliorhinus, from off the coast of the Philippines
Our SMALLEST jaw!
Cat shark is commonly called dogfish, with over 110 species recorded.
THESE SHARKS ARE NOT CAUGHT FOR THEIR JAWS.  All shark jaws are obtained from the legal fishing industry in the Philippines and off the coast of India in the Indian Ocean.   These sharks are caught for their hides & meat.  The jaws & teeth are sold as a collectible to recycle 100% of the shark.
We do not support sport fishing, illegal taking of sharks, we don't even eat in restaurants that serve Shark Fin soup due to the cruel and wasteful nature of shark finning.  We do not catch sharks ourselves.

The whitetip reef shark (

(NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE OCEANIC WHITE TIP SHARK
Carcharhinus longimanus)
is a species of requiem shark, family Carcharhinidae, and the only member of its genus.  A small shark usually not exceeding 1.6 m (5.2 ft) in length, this species is easily recognizable by its slender body and short but broad head, as well as tubular skin flaps beside the nostrils, oval eyes with vertical pupils, and white-tippeddorsal and caudal fins.
THIS IS THE EXACT JAW YOU WOULD RECEIVE.  Awesome
jaw!  Great gift for the shark lover!
One of Heidi's favorites!
THESE SHARKS ARE NOT CAUGHT FOR THEIR JAWS.  All shark jaws are obtained from the legal fishing industry in the Philippines and off the coast of India in the Indian Ocean.   These sharks are caught for their hides & meat.  The jaws & teeth are sold as a collectible to recycle 100% of the shark.
We do not support sport fishing, illegal taking of sharks, we don't even eat in restaurants that serve Shark Fin soup due to the cruel and wasteful nature of shark finning.  We do not catch sharks ourselves.

Hammerhead Showers® ALL METAL Hand Held Shower Head - CHROME - 2.5 GPM High
Description
BUILT TO LAST A LIFETIME - Unlike cheap plastic bathroom shower heads that easily break and leak, HammerHead Showers are ALL METAL and reinforced with COMMERCIAL-GRADE FINISHES that never flake or rust.
Bring a new level of versatility and comfort to your shower. With a 4 inch spray face and custom silicone nozzles, the water is sculpted into rain shower like rainfall drops for immersing coverage.
Perfect replacement handheld shower wand for broken plastic shower handles or to pair up with a sleek slide bar or wall mount shower holder.
Universal 1/2"" NPT thread size makes it a breeze to unscrew your old hand held from your shower hose and screw this new one on.
BUY WITH CONFIDENCE – With our products backed for lifetime, you can count on our PRODUCT EXPERTS who are available by PHONE, EMAIL AND LIVE CHAT SUPPORT.
Product Description
Would this be good for a home with low water pressure?
Absolutely! Our special shower nozzles pressurize water for a boost, and top-grade Neoperl flow regulators ensure consistent flow, even in low pressure. Most flow restrictors will give even less flow than the stated rate if you have low pressure.
Where is the flow restrictor located?
The flow restrictor is located behind the screened washer inside of the shower head holder. The flow regulator is green.
Do you need any plumbing experience for the installation?
No, there's no plumbing experience needed to install our product. Every box comes with everything you need plus a detailed instructions manual.
ABOUT US
We offer the best prices around on high quality products. Our E-store includes media such as books, movies, music and games while offering electronics, toys, sporting apparel, clothing, tools, general home, garden items and more.

Awesome display jaw ! Great gift for the shark lover! THIS IS THE EXACT JAW YOU WILL RECEIVE SANDTIGER (COMMON) SHARK The Smallt**th Sand Tiger usually has t**th (especially the lateral t**th) with two cusplets on each side whereas the Common Sand Tiger always has only one set of cusplets on each side of the t**th. The Smallt**th used to be very rare, but now the Common Sand Tiger has become the rarer shark. It's because the Common Sand Tiger is a shallow water species, and the fishermen have wiped out the shallow water sharks. Now they have moved to deeper water where the Smallt**th is found, and so we are seeing more of these turn up. So, a Common Sand Tiger jaw is now worth more than the jaw from a Smallt**th Sand Tiger. THESE SHARKS ARE NOT CAUGHT FOR THEIR JAWS. All shark jaws are obtained from the legal fishing industry in the Philippines and off the coast of India in the Indian Ocean. These sharks are caught for their hides & meat. The jaws & t**th are sold as a collectible to recycle 100% of the shark. We do not support sport fishing, illegal taking of sharks, we don't even eat in restaurants that serve Shark Fin soup due to the cruel and wasteful nature of shark finning. We do not catch sharks ourselves. Click on our Ebay store tag for MANY more shark items! INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS: There is a $93 fee we are required to pay U.S. Fish & Wildlife to inspect the package going outside the United States.

Just imagine the size and power of the animal that had teeth like this. Very large Megalodons had teeth over 7 inches and up to about 300 of them in jaws up to 7 feet across. The largest Megalodons are believed to have been over 60 feet long and weighing over 60 tons. They are an extinct species of mackerel shark that lived approximately 23 to 3.6 million years ago, from the Early Miocene to the Pliocene epochs. Their teeth have been found worldwide. This may in fact be the largest verifiably measured Megalodon tooth known. This monster tooth was found in Ocucaje, Peru It measures 182mm or 7.113 inches on the longest slant angle. It resides in a private collection in Peru. It was photographed, measured and cast by Craig Sundell, a researcher from the University of Kansas in the 1990s. The tooth is not a composite and has not been restored. There is a repaired crack because the tooth was found broken but it was a clean break. The replica tooth offered for sale here is a direct cast from that tooth. Fossil Megalodon teeth are relatively common in some areas of the world, such as the coastal regions of the SE United State. Most adult Megalodon teeth fall into the 4-5? size range. As teeth approach 6 inches they become rare, representing far less than 1% of teeth. These 6-inch teeth obviously represented extremely large individual sharks. Very few Megalodon teeth have ever been found exceeding 7 inches. Many people who have spent their lifetime?s finding and collecting Megalodon teeth have never had their hands on a 7+ inch tooth. Determining what is truly the largest Megalodon tooth found is problematic, because just like with fishing, people like to exaggerate.

Perfect for resale in stores or either as jewelry, collector specimens, or as part of a traditional Hawaiian war club. Teeth in photo are a SAMPLE of what you will receive although we guarantee all teeth to be the correct size, perfect quality, and similar shapes. All teeth are byproducts of the commercial fishing industry in Southern Asia (primary use is for food). These sharks were not targeted/killed for their jaws or fins (which is deplorable and we would never support by buying any of those products). Legally imported with a USFWS permit and non-protected species, completely legal to trade in every way. Please do not support the trade in protected species (especially Great Whites) by purchasing them through countries that do not participate in CITES (specifically China) as they are targeting protected species for profit. Plus while it may be technically legal for them to be sold (from China for example) they are most definitely not legal to import into most countries (US, UK, AU, etc. etc.) so you may well be unknowingly breaking a pretty serious (and often enforced) law by bringing them into your country. 100% authentic.

Please note:  Pictures are an example of what you will be receiving.  The tails are in different positions in all displays.
K32d #2    This is a nice display of a Torpedo fish or Brown Electric Stingray showcased in a floating display with glass eyes.  Would look great in any collection or great for a classroom presentation as both sides are very visible and the display itself can be easily handled!  This is for one display and Stingray and will be picked at random.  I have pictured several and the are all very similar.
Framed Display Approx. Diminsions: 3 x 3 x 2""
This is nicely showcased in a shadowbox type frame that suspends him in a clear elasticity film so both sides may be viewed unobstructed and also gives the specimen the
illusion of ""floating""!
This can be opened but I advise against it as the specimens or the elasticity strip usually are damaged when you open the display.  If the film in your display starts to stick together or gets some bubbles in it you can open the case very slowly so the film releases from both side and close again very slowly and the problem should be resolved.  If the film gets touched are is in a hot area this can happen but it is a very easy fix also s
ometimes in shipping the specimen can shift a little in the display.  If this happens please contact us and we will direct you on a quick and easy fix.
Once the display has been opened returns are no longer accepted.
HANGING DISPLAYS:  The floating displays all have removable bases so if you would like,  just a piece or two of Velcro or command strip will mount these right to your wall without a problem.
The case will keep him clean and safe for years to come!

Awesome display jaw ! Great gift for the shark lover! THIS IS THE EXACT JAW YOU WILL RECEIVE SANDTIGER (COMMON) SHARK The Smallt**th Sand Tiger usually has t**th (especially the lateral t**th) with two cusplets on each side whereas the Common Sand Tiger always has only one set of cusplets on each side of the t**th. The Smallt**th used to be very rare, but now the Common Sand Tiger has become the rarer shark. It's because the Common Sand Tiger is a shallow water species, and the fishermen have wiped out the shallow water sharks. Now they have moved to deeper water where the Smallt**th is found, and so we are seeing more of these turn up. So, a Common Sand Tiger jaw is now worth more than the jaw from a Smallt**th Sand Tiger. THESE SHARKS ARE NOT CAUGHT FOR THEIR JAWS. All shark jaws are obtained from the legal fishing industry in the Philippines and off the coast of India in the Indian Ocean. These sharks are caught for their hides & meat. The jaws & t**th are sold as a collectible to recycle 100% of the shark.

SHARPNOSE 7-GILL JAW Sharpnose 7 gill is also known as one-finned, perlon, snouted, and slender sevengill shark. Found in all oceans except the north Atlantic Ocean & Mediterranean Sea. Found in waters up to 1870' deep but also in deep channels & bays, and prefers rocky bottom habitats. The Sharpnose is different from the other 7-gill sharks due to the lack of black spots along its body. They grow up to 10' long and 236 pounds, life expectancy: 50 years. It sometimes hunts in packs, an opportunistic predator that will eat almost anything (shark, dolphin, bony fishes, humans). Its predators include the great white shark. This is one of the few species of sharks with seven pairs of gill slits while others usually have five. THESE SHARKS ARE NOT CAUGHT FOR THEIR JAWS. All shark jaws are obtained from the legal fishing industry in the Philippines and off the coast of India in the Indian Ocean. These sharks are caught for their hides & meat. The jaws & t**th are sold as a collectible to recycle 100% of the shark.

Perfect for resale in stores or either as jewelry, collector specimens, or as part of a traditional Hawaiian war club. Teeth in photo are a SAMPLE of what you will receive although we guarantee all teeth to be the correct size, perfect quality, and similar shapes. All teeth are byproducts of the commercial fishing industry in Southern Asia (primary use is for food). These sharks were not targeted/killed for their jaws or fins (which is deplorable and we would never support by buying any of those products). Legally imported with a USFWS permit and non-protected species, completely legal to trade in every way. Please do not support the trade in protected species (especially Great Whites) by purchasing them through countries that do not participate in CITES (specifically China) as they are targeting protected species for profit. Plus while it may be technically legal for them to be sold (from China for example) they are most definitely not legal to import into most countries (US, UK, AU, etc. etc.) so you may well be unknowingly breaking a pretty serious (and often enforced) law by bringing them into your country. 100% authentic. Free shipping by First Class or Priority Mail (depending on weight) anywhere in the USA. Credit cards are accepted. Thanks for viewing and your bid.
